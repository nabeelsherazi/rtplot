- The resize event axes update hack doesn't work for 3D plots. Have to figure out a workaround.

- Add statics for 3D plots

- Refactor the way lines are registered to each plot so it's possible to stop plotting a line at any time
    - This would also store line heads and lines together, and provide a way to mark whether lines will
      express their heads or not

- Refactor FPS to a percentage calculation, which looks at the time between data being provided and the
  time it takes to plot a frame and calculates whether data is being provided faster than it can be plotted
  or not.
